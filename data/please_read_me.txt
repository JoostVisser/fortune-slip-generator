How to add your own fortunes
----------------------------
Check out the `fortune_settings.yaml` file to see how the data is stored.
By default, the fortunes are written in the `text` folder.

You can add or edit these files with any editor (like notepad) to add your own fortunes.
Just make sure to save them as `.yaml` files.
